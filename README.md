# Proxy Design Pattern in User Registration System

## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the User Registration System! In this project, we explore the **Proxy Design Pattern**, a powerful structural pattern that acts as an intermediary for another object. This pattern is not just a theoretical concept; it has practical applications that can enhance your software architecture, improve security, and optimize performance.

## 📜 What is the Proxy Design Pattern?

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It consists of three main components:

1. **Subject Interface**: Defines the methods that both the Proxy and RealSubject will implement.
2. **RealSubject**: The core object that performs the actual logic—in this case, user registration.
3. **Proxy**: The intermediary that manages access to the RealSubject, adding additional functionality and control.

### 🎨 Registration Flow

1. **User Input**: Users enter their registration details.
2. **Proxy Validation**: The Proxy checks the input for validity and permissions.
3. **RealSubject Registration**: If everything checks out, the Proxy delegates the request to the RealSubject to handle the registration.

## 💡 Benefits of Using the Proxy Pattern

### 1. **Access Control**
   - Secure sensitive operations by validating permissions before proceeding.

### 2. **Lazy Initialization**
   - Delay the creation of resource-heavy objects until absolutely necessary, saving memory and processing power.

### 3. **Enhanced Logging**
   - Implement monitoring features within the Proxy to track usage and identify patterns.

### 4. **Performance Improvement**
   - Cache results in the Proxy to speed up response times for common requests.

## 🔍 Other Applications of the Proxy Pattern

- **Virtual Proxies**: Great for delaying the instantiation of heavy objects until they are needed.
- **Protection Proxies**: Enforce security policies and restrict access based on user roles.
- **Remote Proxies**: Facilitate communication with objects located in different address spaces, ideal for distributed systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/JavadTorabiKh/ProxyDesignPattern.git
  cd ProxyDesignPattern

  # Install dependencies (if applicable)
  pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 2: Run the Application
Start the application and follow the prompts to register a user. The Proxy will seamlessly manage the registration process for you.
